## Quick Build Recommendation  

- Put your highest ability score in **Strength** or **Dexterity**, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons).
- Put your next-highest score in **Intelligence** or **Constitution**, depending on whether you want to increase the potency of blood curses or have additional hit points to empower your abilities.
- Choose the [soldier]() or [urchin]() background.
